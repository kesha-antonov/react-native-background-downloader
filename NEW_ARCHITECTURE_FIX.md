# New Architecture Event Fix

This document explains the fix for the React Native new architecture event handling issue.

## Problem

In React Native's new architecture (Fabric/TurboModules), the `downloadBegin` and `downloadProgress` events were not firing on Android, causing downloads to appear to jump straight from start to completion without intermediate progress events.

## Solution

The fix adds JavaScript bridge readiness detection to the Android implementation, similar to how the iOS version already handled this scenario.

## How It Works

1. **Event Deferral**: When events are emitted before JavaScript is ready, they are stored in a queue
2. **Readiness Detection**: The `addListener()` method is used as a signal that JavaScript is ready to receive events
3. **Deferred Emission**: Once JavaScript is ready, all queued events are emitted in order

## Testing

You can verify the fix works by enabling logging and checking that all events fire:

```javascript
import RNBackgroundDownloader from '@kesha-antonov/react-native-background-downloader';

// Enable logging to see events
RNBackgroundDownloader.setConfig({
    isLogsEnabled: true,
});

const task = RNBackgroundDownloader.download({
    id: 'test-download',
    url: 'https://example.com/large-file.zip',
    destination: '/path/to/destination.zip',
})
.begin((info) => {
    console.log('Download began:', info.expectedBytes, 'bytes');
})
.progress((info) => {
    console.log('Progress:', info.bytesDownloaded, '/', info.bytesTotal);
})
.done(() => {
    console.log('Download completed!');
});
```

Expected log output:
```
[RNBackgroundDownloader] download ...
[RNBackgroundDownloader] downloadBegin ...
[RNBackgroundDownloader] downloadProgress-1 ...
[RNBackgroundDownloader] downloadProgress-2 ...
[RNBackgroundDownloader] downloadComplete ...
```

## Compatibility

This fix is fully backward compatible and doesn't affect existing functionality in older React Native versions.
